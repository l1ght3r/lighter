* Framework

    Here are the next steps to obtain a correct first version:

        * Debug should have its configuration data into the Config object
        * Debug should use templates for reports instead of the xml config file
        * A logger with different level of log should be implemented. Since it's a
          similar feature than debug, maybe it's possible to merge the 2 concepts.
        * continue to separate the framework from the app (media files may be a part
          of the app -  at this time, the include folder is neither a part of the 
          framework nor the app)
        * DataAccessor objects should use both collections and database
        * DataAccessor objects should implements basic validation methods (or a Helper
          should do so)
        * gettext should be correctly implemented
        * SessionManager should be implemented (at this time, it's an old object
          which hasn't been converted to this framework)
        * the helpers collection should be bigger
        * ALL the code must be correctly commented
        * a PHPUnit test pack should be created
        * the path object need to be improved define URI more efficiently. At this
          time, the basic module admin have navigation bugs because of the URI.

* Modules

    As a second step, the framework part will have a few basic module which will
    offer basic common fonctionnality, such as users management, page content,
    news plugin, etc.

** user_mod

    This will be the first module added to the framework. It should be capable of
    manage users and groups, in a basic way. Not too much features: just the ability
    to edit a group or member profile by an administrator. The module should also
    provide a basic login form.
    
    The capability to permit to visitor to create an account will be managed in
    another module.

** content_mod
    
    This module will offer the ability to edit and display simple page in a website.
    The user_mod module will be necessary to protect the administration page.

** menu_mod

    This module will implement a menu definition system and a plugin to display it in
    a webpage. The menu should be an extension to the routing system.

** more
    
    Many modules could be done this way. More to come...
